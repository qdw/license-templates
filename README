./bsd is the simplified two-clause BSD license, the simplest extant BSD license
as of this writing.

./public-domain I copy-and-pasted from http://unlicense.org/ , but I removed
the propaganda URL at the bottom. I don't think the public domain is the right
solution to all licensing problems, unlike the unlicense.org author(s).
