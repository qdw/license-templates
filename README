Here are some license templates that I use to speed up development.
When I release a project, I choose one license file, copy-and-paste it
into $PROJECT_ROOT/LICENSE, and edit the template as appropriate.

./bsd is a template for the simplified two-clause BSD license, which is the
simplest BSD license as of this writing. This template requires editing.

./public-domain I copy-and-pasted from http://unlicense.org/ , but I removed
the propaganda URL at the bottom. I don't think the public domain is the right
solution to all licensing problems, unlike the unlicense.org author(s).
This template does not require editing; you can use it as-is.
